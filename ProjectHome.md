**PolActions is a collection of Automator actions for Mac OS X Leopard and later.**

## Available Actions ##

  * Create Evernote Note With File: creates a new Evernote note for each input file.
    * A Premium Evernote account might be required for some types of files.
    * The note is created directly on the Evernote servers, so no need to have the Evernote app installed or running and no need for syncing either.
  * Scan Document: scans a document and creates a corresponding image file.
    * An Image Capture compatible scanner is required.
